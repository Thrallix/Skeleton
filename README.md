# Skeleton 1.0
#### A skeleton Model View Controller by Thrallix.

Enjoy the latest MVC to build your project on.\
Now fully supportive of _SCSS_ and _NodeJS_.\
Feel free to use this core as an template to your own projects.\
\
Will soon add database support :)

#### Hint:

* Make sure you have **NodeJS** installed.\
You can find it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
* After installing, head over to `/assets` and run "npm install".
* You can now use `gulp watch` to build your SCSS and JavaScript.
* The proper way to do this is by editing `assets/resources/src`.
